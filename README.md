# UDP receiver

As the name suggests this code receives UDP messages. It also replies to the sender with a message to confirm the packet was received successfully!

The UDP Sender is coming soon!


## Note

Do note that UDP only works when both the sending and receiving code are on the same network, If you wish to send packets outside your own network you can set up Port forwarding on both routers.
